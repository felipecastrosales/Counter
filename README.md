   Challenges and Learnings along the way ü§Ø
   </h2>

   The development of this application was one of my experiences with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/). I am and I get along very well with this [Dart](https://dart.dev/) framework.<br>
   In this app I had a short introduction to widgets, going straight to the [documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), and also through practice.<br>
   Like any project, I had my challenges, I had some errors along the way, but they were quickly resolved.<br>
   In addition, this was a simple application, which I managed to develop very well, I hope to continue evolving in Flutter, as I am loving this experience so much.
